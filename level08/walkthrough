binary take a path to a file as argument
it first try to read ./backup/.logs so we have the be in the level09 directory to exec
then he cat "./backups/" and the path, read the file and put the content into /backups/path
problem is if the path contain a / (like in /home/users/level09/.pass for example), the output
path will be './backups//home...' so we have to avoid puting a / at the start of the path
so we can just create a symbolic link to the level09/.pass in the level08 dir and then gg

final command : 
    ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass pouet && ./level08 pouet && cat ./backups/pouet

(need to finish reverese engineering btw)
